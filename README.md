# Coffee-Shop-Sales-SQL-Analysis
A comprehensive SQL-based data analysis project investigating coffee shop transactions to identify sales trends, peak hours, and product performance using advanced SQL queries and data visualization


# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of sales data for a coffee shop operating in multiple locations. Using **SQL**, I processed thousands of transaction records to uncover key business metrics, such as monthly revenue growth, peak sales hours, and top-performing product categories.

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed
- What is the total revenue generated each month?
- How much is the Month-on-Month (MoM) growth in sales?
- Which days and hours experience the highest footfall (Peak Hours)?
- Which product categories (Coffee, Tea, Bakery) contribute most to the total sales?
- What are the top-selling products by quantity and revenue?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL (MySQL/SQL Server):** For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Excel/CSV:** Raw transaction data source.
- **PowerPoint:** For presenting key business findings.

## 📊 Key Features & Queries
- **Sales Metrics:** Calculated Total Sales, Total Orders, and Total Quantity Sold for different time periods.
- **Trend Analysis:** Developed queries to track daily and hourly sales patterns.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compared daily sales against average sales to identify "Above Average" performance days.
- **Product Intelligence:** Categorized sales by product type and size (Small, Medium, Large) to understand customer preferences.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Coffee Shop Transactions.sql`: Contains all the SQL scripts and analytical queries.
- `Coffee Shop Sales - Transactions.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
- `Coffee Shop SQL Project.pptx`: A presentation summarizing the business insights.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Identified specific peak hours (morning rush) where staffing should be increased.
- Noticed a steady Month-on-Month growth in sales across all locations.
- 'Coffee' and 'Tea' categories remain the primary revenue drivers, with 'Large' sizes being the most popular.
